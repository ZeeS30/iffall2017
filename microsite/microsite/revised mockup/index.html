		<h2> Questions </h2>
		<ul>
		<li>Is it okay that every page be very consistent design wise or do we want more variety? I was trying to be very minimal in the changes in order to keep the focus on him and his work. </li>
		<li>Do we definitely want to link back to his portfolio page? (is that allowed) </li>
		</ul>
		<h2> Notes </h2>
		<ul>
		<li>The images on the early life page slide over as you click but text does not change.</li>
		<li>On the works page, the images are in black and white until you hover then they change to cover and are highlighted by a gray bar and tells you the cateogry</li>
		</ul>
		Let me know any other concerns, this may not be final im still tweaking and tinkering with things.
