	<h1> ZECORA POSTCARD FEEDBACK </h1>
		<p>
			<em>Aesthetic</em>
				<ul>
					<li>The designs are striking have a clear vision and theme, the design relates and gives each image a setting to live in.The aesthetic is changing not fully consistent in all. Typeface choice is curious. Helps for the most part. Gets difficult in quote 2 she is being overpowered by surroundings. we loose focus of the important aspect which is her</li></ul>
					</br>
					</br>
			<em>Structure</em>
				<ul>
					<li>The visual prioties are patterns/backgrounds and the subject, Cardi B. The design elements are working in compliment particularly color. There is a very literal foreground and background imagery in these postcards and the text plays on the foreground level as well. The use of text wrapping and scale will accommodate browser width changes</li></ul>
					</br>
					</br>
			<em>Technical Challenges</em>
				<ul>
					<li> The text runs into the images and becomes illegible or it run out of the browser window and becomes completely hidden. The text collides with imagery in high high or low contrast areas where the colors begin to clash. The first quote image gets a little distorted. I think the image edges have been loosely considered in relation to the text but more so with the background image. Not all fonts will be supported in the browser environment so accomodations must be made for that. I can build a version of each one.</li></ul></p>
